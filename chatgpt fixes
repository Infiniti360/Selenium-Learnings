Why it breaks only on GitHub Actions
	1.	The workflow runs your tests inside the official cypress/* Docker image.
That image drops root privileges and runs as user 1001.
	2.	actions/checkout leaves every file in the workspace owned by root (UID 0).
Locally you own the repo, so fs.writeFileSync() can create
cypress/fixtures/…/tradeboardExtract-…xlsx.
Inside the container the non-root user does not have write permission, so
Node throws

EACCES: permission denied, open
'cypress/fixtures/US/Tradeboard/tradeboardExtract_EQUITYINDEXTRADERPM.xlsx'


	3.	The same problem appears with other writable locations (cache, screenshots, videos) and is called out in the Cypress-action docs: adding --user 1001 (or changing ownership) avoids “permissions issues”  ￼.

Two proven fixes

Fix	What to do	Pros / Cons
A. Tell Docker to run as UID 0 (root)	```yaml	
jobs:		
e2e:		

runs-on: ubuntu-latest
container:
  image: cypress/browsers:latest      # or your pinned tag
  options: --user 0                  # run as root

| **B. Keep user 1001 and chown the workspace** |```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4

  # make the whole repo writable by uid 1001 *before* Cypress starts
  - name: Fix permissions
    run: sudo chown -R 1001:1001 "$GITHUB_WORKSPACE"

  - uses: cypress-io/github-action@v6
    # ...
```|Keeps container hardening, only one extra step.<br>Needs `sudo` (present in GH runners). |

Either approach unblocks file creation so the Excel download succeeds.

## Optional clean-ups to make the tests CI-friendly

<details>
<summary>1. Stop writing into <code>cypress/fixtures</code></summary>

`cypress/fixtures` is committed to git and can be mounted read-only in some CI
environments.  
Prefer the built-in **`downloadsFolder`** (you already set it to
`cypress/downloads`) or an OS-tmp dir:

```ts
const downloads = Cypress.config('downloadsFolder');
const tradeboardDir = path.join(downloads, domicile.toUpperCase(), 'Tradeboard');

cy.downloadFile(url, tradeboardDir, `${fileName}.xlsx`);

cy.task('generateJSONFromExcel', {
  excelFilePath: path.join(tradeboardDir, `${fileName}.xlsx`),
  sheetname: 'TradeBoard Details'
});

</details>


<details>
<summary>2. Harden the plugin helpers</summary>


async function ensureFolder(folderPath: string) {
  await fs.promises.mkdir(folderPath, { recursive: true, mode: 0o777 });
  return { success: true };
}

Add the same mode flag (or check fs.constants.W_OK) in
writeToExcel() and deleteFilesInFolder() if you keep writing inside the repo.

TL;DR

The tests fail because the Docker user (UID 1001) can’t write to files owned by
root.
Run the container as root or chown the workspace to UID 1001 before the
cypress-io/github-action step.
After that the Excel download and parsing code you showed will work unchanged,
and the entire E2E suite will pass in GitHub Actions.
